# Challenge Expanded Instructions

The objective of this challenge is for learners to gather additional information by using repetition and decision statements with membership and logical operators, print the data to the command line, and save data to an output file, and write a report on the election analysis.

## Deliverable 1: The Election Results Printed to the Command Line

For the first deliverable, we are asking the learners to use their knowledge of `for loops`, `if` statements with membership and logical operators, and write print statements using `f-strings` to print the candidate and county election results to the command line.

We have provided the learners with a [PyPoll Challenge starter code](PyPoll_challenge_starter_code.py) that includes the solution for the election results for Module 3, and has commented steps in the starter code file where learners will need to add the code to complete this part of the challenge.

## Deliverable 2: The Election Results Saved to a Text File

For the second deliverable, we are asking the learners to use their knowledge of writing data to file to add the winning candidate results and the county election results to the `election_analysis.txt` text file.

In the [PyPoll Challenge starter code](PyPoll_challenge_starter_code.py) we have provided commented steps in the starter code file where learners will need to add the code to complete this part of the challenge.

## Delivering Results: Written Analysis of the Election Audit

The goal of the writing assignment is for students to present their findings in a logical manner. As a reminder, learners should use appropriate grammar and structure when writing.

For the written analysis, learners should use the repository markdown file to write their report. The report will contain three sections: an overview of the election audit, election audit results, and election audit summary.

**Overview of Election Audit:** Explain the purpose of this analysis.

**Election Audit Results:** Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images of examples of your code if necessary to support your evidence.

- How many total votes were cast in this congressional election?

- Provide a breakdown of number of votes and percentage of total votes for each county each in the precinct.
- Which county had the largest number of votes?

- Provide a breakdown of the number votes and percentage of total votes each candidate received.

- Which candidate won the election, what was their total number of votes and percentage of total votes?

**Election Audit Summary:** In a summary statement provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used for any election with some modifications. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to meet business requirements to convince the election commission to use this script for future elections.

The markdown document file should be in the home directory of their repository. All links should be working, and images and code should be formatted and displayed where appropriate.

## Grading Rubric

The [PyPoll Grading Rubric](PyPoll_Grading_Rubric.pdf) is provided for you to use when grading the learners' submissions.
