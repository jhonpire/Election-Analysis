# Election-Analysis
Election Analysis developed for Tom using Python

## Project Overview
A board of elections employee from Colorado, has provided the following tasks
to complete an election audit for a recent congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
Data source: Election_Results.csv
Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.62.3

### Summary
The results of the election found with out analysis were:
There were 3 candidates
* Charles Casper Stockham
* Diana DeGette
* Raymon Anthony Doane

### The candidate Results were
* Charles Casper Stockham received 23.o% of the votes (85,213)
* Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the votes (272,892)
* Raymond Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the votes (11,606)

### The winner of the election was
Diana DeGette receiving 73.8% of the votes

## Challenge Overview
The analysis of the elections data (election_results.csv) demonstrated that it is possible to automate the calculations needed to process the information received from local elections and possibly be replicated on other locations by simply repurposing the same code, which would save time and resources.

## Challenge Summary
On this challenge we were able to utilize Python combined to Visual Studio Code, to process a very large source of information. The project was developed in collaboration of 2 members of the elections commitee from Colorado as a test run, with the posibility of replicating the techniques onto other local elections. The analysis was generated with maximum efficiency once the requirements were clearly defined.
